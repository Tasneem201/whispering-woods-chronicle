Elara, a brave and curious 16-year-old villager, has fiery auburn hair and bright green eyes. Dressed in a tattered cloak and worn leather boots, sheâ€™s known for exploring the forbidden woods near her home. She recently discovered a mysterious glowing map buried beneath the roots of a whispering oak.

Shadow is a large, silent wolf with a sleek coat as dark as midnight and eyes that glint like silver in the moonlight. Fiercely loyal to Elara, he appeared the night she found the map, as if drawn by fate. He watches over her with calm, protective vigilance.

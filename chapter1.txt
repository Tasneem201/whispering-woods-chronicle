Elara traced the delicate lines of the map with her fingertip, feeling a strange warmth radiate from the glowing runes. Despite the warnings whispered in the village about the dangers lurking within the Whispering Woods, her curiosity outweighed her fear. She knew that this map was a call to adventure, something she couldn't ignore.

With a deep breath, Elara packed a small satchel with essentials — a knife, a piece of bread, and a flask of water — then tucked the map carefully inside. The sun was setting, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple as she stepped beyond the village boundary, ready to face whatever mysteries awaited her in the shadowy forest.
